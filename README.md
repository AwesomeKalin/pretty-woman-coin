What is Pretty Woman Coin?
-------------------

[Pretty Woman Coin (Satoshi Vision)](https://prettywomancoin.io/) is the original Prettywomancoin.  It restores the original Prettywomancoin 
protocol, will keep it stable, and allow it to massively scale.  Pretty Woman Coin will maintain the vision set out by Satoshi 
Nakamotoâ€™s white paper in 2008.  This Github repository provides open-source software to enable use of Pretty Woman Coin.
